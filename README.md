# individual_fa20
This contains my individual Data Science project for COGS 108 (Fa20). It contains the proposal, the final Jupyter notebook, and the data files. My project intends to identify the relationship between amount of different amenities and review ratings of public parks, and between amount of different amenities and review count of public parks.
